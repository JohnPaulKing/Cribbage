# Cribbage

This is a project I made in my free time to get more familiar with the C programming language, and basic game programming in terminal.

#Limitations
1. For now, this game only runs correctly on unix operating systems.
2. Depending on the shell you use, the arrow keys will not move the selected cards. You will have to enter an arrow key and then press enter, in order for the shell to send the text to the process.
